# fake-gpu

## Project Overview

The `fake-gpu` project is designed to simulate GPU information, making it easier to test scenarios where a GPU is not available. This can be particularly useful for development and testing purposes in environments that lack physical GPU hardware.

## Usage

To use the fake GPU, follow these steps:

1. Build the project (see the Compilation section below).
2. Set the environment variable `sourceHostPath` to the path where the fake GPU library is located.
3. Run your application with the fake GPU library.

## Compilation

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., CMake, Git).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chaunceyjiang/fake-gpu.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fake-gpu`
4. Run the build process: `make`

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the `fake-gpu` project. To contribute, follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request to the main repository.

Please ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
